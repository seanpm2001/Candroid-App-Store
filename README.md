# [Candroid](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Candroid/) App Store

`Candroid does things different. The Candroid app store is a library of APK client wrappers (F-Droid, APKPure, etc.) For the main Candroid app store, try visiting the Candroid Market.`

## Install

The project is currently in the Alpha stage of development, and is not yet functional.

## Structure

The Candroid App Store is a wrapper for multiple APK clients. Currently, 2 client choices are planned:

- F-Droid
- APKPure

For a vanilla, from scratch app store for Candroid, [try the Candroid Market!](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Candroid-Market/)
